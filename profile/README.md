## History

AcaciaLinux started as a school project to learn about the building blocks of a Linux distribution.
The plan is to now use all of that knowledge to build a stable, fast and easy-to-use Linux distribution.

## Repositories

The main repository of interest is the [tooling repository](https://github.com/AcaciaLinux/tooling) - a monorepo that contains all the programs that facilitate the operations performed in this distribution.
